Overview
========

`NOAH <https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/noah-multiparameterization-land-surface-model-noah-mp-lsm>`_
is the land surface model that is commonly used in WRF applications.

It has been superceded in prominence by the Noah Multiparameterization
(Noah-MP) model. Members of the Data Assimilation Research Section have 
experience with NOAH-MP and its implmentation within WRF-Hydro.

Please contact the DART group at `dart@ucar.edu <dart@ucar.edu>`_ for
advisement if you are considering using Noah.
