Downloading DART
################

The DART source code is distributed on the GitHub repository
`NCAR/DART <https://github.com/NCAR/DART>`_ with the documentation
served through GitHub Pages at http://dart.ucar.edu.

Go to https://github.com/NCAR/DART and clone the repository or get the
ZIP file according to your preference. See the `github help page on
cloning <https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository>`_
for more information on how to clone a repository. Take note of the
directory you installed into, which is referred to as *DARTHOME* throughout 
this documentation.

.. note::

   If you are interested in contributing to DART, see the
   :doc:`/contributing/contributors-guide` for more information. In short, you
   will need to be familiar with the
   `GitHub workflow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_.

Unzip or clone the distribution in your desired directory, which we refer to as
"DARTHOME" in this document. Compiling the code in this tree (as is usually the
case) may require a large amount of additional disk space (up to the 1 Gb
required for DART), so be aware of any disk quota restrictions before
continuing.
